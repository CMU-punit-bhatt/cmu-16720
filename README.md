CMU Course 16720 - Introduction to Computer Vision

Instructor - [Kris Kitani](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/)

## Course overview

This course introduces the fundamental techniques used in computer vision, that is, the analysis of patterns in visual images to reconstruct and understand the objects and scenes that generated them. Topics covered include image formation and representation, camera geometry and calibration, multi-view geometry, stereo, 3D reconstruction from images, motion analysis, image segmentation, object recognition. The material is based on graduate-level texts augmented with research papers, as appropriate. Graduate students completing this course will be well prepared to comprehend current research in computer vision or apply state-of-the-art techniques to problems of interest in their own field. Evaluation is based on homeworks and final project. The homeworks involve considerable Matlab programming exercises.

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of linear algebra, vector calculus, and basic probability are required. MATLAB programming experience and previous exposure to image processing are desirable, but not required.

## Recommended course materials

Computer Vision, A Modern Approach by Forsyth and Ponce.
Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications by Szeliski. Book in progress with online draft.
Robot Vision by Horn. Classic text on machine vision.

## Grading

5 homeworks worth 17% each, and class participation (measured by Piazza answers following our guidelines) worth 3%.
