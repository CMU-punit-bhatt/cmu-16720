    "1. Students are encouraged to work in groups but each student must submit their own work. Include the names of your collaborators in your write up. Code should <span style='color:red'>Not</span>  be shared or copied. Please properly give credits to others by <span style='color:red'>LISTING EVERY COLLABORATOR</span> in the writeup including any code segments that you discussed,  Please <span style='color:red'>DO NOT</span>  use external code unless permitted.

    "# Preliminaries\n",
    "In this section, we will go through some of the basics of the Lucas-Kanade tracker and the Matthews-Baker tracker. The following table contains a summary of the variables used in the rest of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](img/variables.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Template\n",
    "A template describes the object of interest (eg. a car, football) which we wish to track in a video. Traditionally, the tracking algorithm is initialized with a template, which is represented by a bounding box around the object to be tracked in the first frame of the video. For each of the subsequent frames in the video, the tracker will update its estimate of the object in the image. The tracker achieves this by updating its affine warp.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Warps\n",
    "What is a warp? An image transformation or warp $\\textbf{W}$ is a function that acts on pixel coordinates $\\textbf{x} = \\left[u\\;\\;v\\right]^T$\n",
    "and maps pixel values from one place to another in an image $\\textbf{x}' =\n",
    "\\left[u'\\;\\;v'\\right]^T$. Simply put, $\\textbf{W}$ maps a pixel with coordinates $\\textbf{x} = \\left[u\\;\\;v\\right]^T$ to $\\textbf{x}' =\n",
    "\\left[u'\\;\\;v'\\right]^T$. Translation, rotation, and scaling are all examples of warps. We denote the parameters of the warp function $\\textbf{W}$ by $\\textbf{p}$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{gathered}\n",
    "\\textbf{x}'= \\textbf{W}(\\textbf{x};\\textbf{p})\n",
    "\\end{gathered}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Affine Warp\n",
    "An affine warp is a particular kind of warp that can include any combination of translation, scaling, and rotations. An affine warp can be represented by 6 parameters $\\textbf{p} = [p_1\\;p_2\\;p_3\\;p_4\\;p_5\\;p_6]^{T}$. One of the most convenient things about an affine warp is that it is linear; its action on a point with coordinates $\\textbf{x} = \\left[u\\;\\;v\\right]^T$ can be described as a matrix operation by a $3 \\times 3$ matrix $\\textbf{W}(\\textbf{p})$:,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} u' \\\\ v' \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right] = \\textbf{W}(\\textbf{p}) \\left[\n",

    "\\textbf{W}(\\textbf{p}) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1+p_1 & p_3 & p_5 \\\\ p_2 & 1+p_4 & p_6 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{gathered}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For convenience, when we want to refer to the warp as a function, we will use $\\textbf{W}(\\textbf{x};\\textbf{p})$ and when we want to refer to the matrix for an affine warp, we will use $\\textbf{W}(\\textbf{p})$. We will use affine warp and affine transformation interchangeably."
